# Batman Movie Cart

A Movie cart done using Angular.js and data from http://www.omdbapi.com. This cart could be modified to be used in other projects as a shoping cart. I build this cart as a Task solution. I was asked to make a shoping cart for a well known store as a test for a posible Job. but API link given wasn't working so i desided to use movies open database instead.
